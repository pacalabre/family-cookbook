## An collaborative space for sharing recipes.

## About

#### This is my final project of General Assembly. For this project, I used the MEAN stack, bootstap, and the Food2Fork API.

##### The approach I took was:
#####1)Set up the basic architecture of the site. This mainly consisted of establishing my routes, dependencies, and making sure that my database, controllers, and static files a were connected properly.

#####2) Basic CSS styling, largely revolving around bootstrap.

#####3) Set up functionality of site - specifically sending information to my database, and setting up my API.

#####4) Finish styling.

## User stories
##### The idea for this site came to me because my family includes a lot of people who love to cook, but we are spread out all over the country. I thought that I'd be nice to have a place where we could all log into and post recipes that we have been playing around with.

## Unsolved Problems and Features to be added
##### I had some trouble implementing the edit button, so I will be adding an edit button if you made the original post. Also, I am going to use Cloudinary so that users will be able to upload pictures of the meal. Finally, I will be adding comments as well to give it more of a social media feel. I may add tags eventually, but I have not reached a definitive decision on that - though that would be a nice way to expand the site beyond the scope of one family while still keeping the orginal intent of the site.
